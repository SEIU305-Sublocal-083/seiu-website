# W02: Website audit and migration plan

**Draft PR only. No publication, email send or schedule.**

This is item 6 of 6 in the Website and news stack. Its base is `codex/strike-n04-official-strike-notice-tentative-agreement-or-changed-timeline-n` (PR #273); its diff adds only this item's directory. Edit this item on its own branch and carry parent updates forward. See [stack workflow](../STACK.md). Keep this PR draft during translation review.

- Intended destination: Internal website migration checklist.
- English source: `copy/en/`. 1 alternative(s), each with its own preview.
- Spanish handoff: `copy/es/` and `title_es` in `item.json`; include `sources/es.md` only when citations are displayed. Spanish is optional for this internal-only plan.
- Full preview: `index.html`; alternatives: `a.en.html`, etc.
- Screenshots: `screenshots/`. These are captures of the rendered HTML.
- Citations: no citation section appears in this page. `sources/en.md` is retained for editorial reference; contact and action links remain in the body.

## Translator and reviewer steps

1. Translate the English alternative(s) that the editor intends to use; retain the other conditional drafts as alternatives.
2. Translate subject lines, preheaders, headings, tables, actions and captions/transcripts. Translate source notes only when `citations` is `collapsed`. Do not invent missing facts or remove qualifications.
3. Mark the variant `ready_for_review`. A bilingual reviewer records `approved`, their name and the SHA-256 of its current English file only after review. Fill `title_es`; record the source-note reviewer only when citations are displayed.
4. An editor selects exactly one variant, resolves the release conditions, and records current fact-check and approval fields. Selection never sends or publishes anything.
5. Run the preview builder, review both languages on desktop/mobile and refresh screenshots. `--release-check` intentionally fails until approvals and facts are complete.

## Item-specific editorial record

Internal recommendation only. Assignments, deadlines and proposed workflows need acceptance. No member case records or rosters are included.

## Packaging note

The earlier working package was planning-only. The user has now authorized separate draft PRs and rendered-page screenshots. That authorization does not approve live changes or sending. All original factual holds continue to apply. Unreviewed machine Spanish is not included in this PR.
